Biomedical Paper 929 Summary:
In the United States, even full-term babies face higher mortality risks than in some European countries with low infant mortality rates. A recent study analyzed birth and death records from 2010-2012 and found that the mortality rate for full-term infants (born at 37-42 weeks) in the US was 2.2 per 1,000 live births. This rate varied widely by state, with the highest rates in Mississippi (3.77 per 1,000) and the lowest in Connecticut (1.29 per 1,000). Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) was the leading cause of death for full-term infants, accounting for 43% of all deaths. Congenital malformations and perinatal conditions accounted for another 31% and 11.3% of deaths, respectively. The study found that the largest mortality differences between states with good and poor infant mortality rates were for SUDI, especially for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and suffocation. Even after accounting for differences in maternal education, race, and health, there was still significant variation in infant mortality rates between states. The study estimates that infant mortality could be reduced by 4,003 deaths annually if all states could achieve the mortality levels of the best-performing states in each cause-of-death category.

Biomedical Paper 930 Summary:
Proteins often interact with other molecules (ligands) to carry out important biological functions. Scientists have been curious about how proteins do this and have proposed two main mechanisms. In this study, we developed a new approach combining different computational methods to determine which mechanism is dominant in the interaction between a protein called ChoX and a molecule called choline. We found that, under normal conditions, ChoX primarily uses a specific mechanism called "conformational selection". This means that ChoX has several different shapes and switches between them to capture its target. This discovery provides insights into how proteins achieve high selectivity and specificity in molecular recognition, a fundamental process in biology. Our approach can be used to understand how other proteins recognize their ligands, which could aid the design of novel drugs and therapies.

Biomedical Paper 931 Summary:
**Summary for the Layperson:** Many people don't realize that reptiles, including venomous snakes, can carry bacteria called Salmonella, which can cause stomach problems and bloodstream infections in humans. This study looked at many venomous snakes and other reptiles to find out how common and different these bacteria are. They found that most venomous snakes carry Salmonella, including many types that can make people sick. These bacteria come from different groups and they have some differences in how they use food. This is the first time scientists have used whole-genome sequencing to study Salmonella in venomous reptiles. This study gives us more information about how Salmonella has evolved and how it spreads in reptiles. It also suggests that venomous snakes may carry types of Salmonella that can infect humans, which could be a potential health concern.

Biomedical Paper 932 Summary:
Genetic research has identified areas of the human genome linked to certain traits and diseases. However, genetic testing using these areas explains only a portion of trait variation. Studies using large family groups have now found that including family relationships in the analysis can capture more of the genetic variation. They also found that the recent shared environment of couples (e.g., experiences within the past 10-20 years) influences certain traits, while the shared environment of family members who grew up together has less impact. This study suggests that future genetic studies should consider family relationships and the shared environment of couples to better understand trait variation and identify contributing factors.

Biomedical Paper 933 Summary:
A rare skin, hair, and tooth disorder has been linked to a newly discovered gene called TSPEAR. This study found mutations in the TSPEAR gene in affected individuals, and showed that the gene is involved in the development of hair and teeth. Experiments showed that mutations in the TSPEAR gene can lead to changes in how cells communicate with each other, which affects the growth and formation of hair and teeth. These findings provide new insights into the causes of this disorder and potential avenues for future treatments.

Biomedical Paper 934 Summary:
Liver cancer is a serious disease with poor outcomes. Researchers have identified a gene called SRC-2 that plays a complex role in liver cancer. In some types of cancers, SRC-2 promotes cancer growth. However, in liver cancer, SRC-2 acts as a tumor suppressor, preventing cancer growth. By activating certain genes, SRC-2 slows down cancer progression. This study highlights the diverse roles of SRC-2 in different types of cancer and provides insights into how it can be targeted for liver cancer treatment.

Biomedical Paper 935 Summary:
Leptospirosis is a serious bacterial disease that can spread from animals to humans, especially in poor urban areas. While contaminated water is known to spread leptospirosis, scientists don't know much about the role of soil. This study tested soil from these areas and found that: * About one-third of soil samples contained harmful leptospirosis bacteria. * Bacteria levels were higher in moist soil. * The bacteria tended to be spread unevenly throughout the soil. These findings suggest that soil may be an important source of leptospirosis in these communities. This information can help health officials develop strategies to prevent the spread of this disease.

Biomedical Paper 936 Summary:
Your eyes have to figure out where something is by reading the signals from special cells in your retinas. Our study simultaneously recorded signals from many of these cells in salamanders and guinea pigs and showed that even hundreds of cells sending information together can't do the job perfectly. We found that most of the cells fire very rarely and in strange patterns, making it unlikely that they can tell the brain where something is accurately. Surprisingly, these cells affect an area of the retina that is much bigger than expected, and many of them even send information about things outside of their usual area of sensitivity. This odd organization means that the same information is often sent by completely different groups of cells. This makes it easier for the brain to read and use the information the eyes send, even if individual cells aren't very accurate.

Biomedical Paper 937 Summary:
During gene expression, the instructions from our DNA are copied and edited into smaller pieces called mRNAs. These are then used to make proteins. The editing process, called splicing, is important and is controlled by proteins that can recognize specific features in the mRNA. In this study, researchers looked at a specific group of proteins called the RES complex in zebrafish. They found that these proteins are essential for early development, particularly for the brain. Without these proteins, fish had defects in their brains, with increased cell death and fewer differentiated neurons. The researchers also discovered that the RES complex helps to splice a set of specific introns, which are regions of the mRNA that get removed during splicing. These introns tend to be short, rich in a certain type of chemical base, and are surrounded by specific features in the mRNA. The researchers developed a model that can predict which introns need the RES complex for proper splicing. Overall, this study highlights the importance of the RES complex in vertebrate development and provides new insights into its role in gene expression by identifying the intronic features associated with its activity.

Biomedical Paper 938 Summary:
A study on worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) has identified a gene called daf-31 that plays a role in their ability to enter a dormant state, known as dauer, in response to starvation. Mutant worms with a damaged daf-31 gene no longer enter dauer properly, but instead form dauer-like worms with some features of dauer but not others. These worms accumulate fat and are sensitive to certain chemicals, unlike normal dauer worms. Researchers found that daf-31 encodes a protein called ARD1, which is involved in adding acetyl groups to other proteins. Interestingly, increasing the activity of daf-31 extends the lifespan of worms that are already long-lived. This suggests that ARD1 may interact with FOXO transcription factors, which are important for longevity, to influence lifespan and other aspects of C. elegans biology. Understanding the role of ARD1 in worms may shed light on its function in mammals and provide insights into aging and other processes.

Biomedical Paper 939 Summary:
Snakebites are a serious problem in tropical regions, but some animals have developed defenses against the venom. Scientists have studied a protein from the opossum's blood, called DM64, which blocks the harmful effects of snake venom. To make it easier to study and potentially develop new treatments for snakebites, they produced a version of DM64 in yeast, called rDM64. The yeast-made rDM64 has similar properties to the natural DM64 and can block the toxic effects of snake venom, offering hope for new therapies to combat snakebite envenomation.

Biomedical Paper 940 Summary:
Cellular processes often involve complex chains of events, where changes in one protein can trigger changes in others, leading to changes in gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. Studying each step of this process individually is useful, but it doesn't fully capture how they all connect. We present a method to build a network that links these different events together. This network can help us identify key points where we can intervene to influence cellular processes. We applied our method to a type of brain tumor called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and identified several new targets for potential drug development. Two of these targets, CREBBP and CTNNB1, have not been previously tested for effectiveness against GBM. We also discovered that a protein called p300, which is highly connected in our network, may play a role in tumorigenesis. Our method can be applied to a wide range of biological datasets to help us better understand cellular processes and identify potential therapeutic targets for diseases like cancer.

Biomedical Paper 941 Summary:
Researchers are developing new ways to study how our genes are regulated, which can affect our health and risk of disease. One method, called MethylSeq, is less expensive than the "gold standard" method but can be inaccurate. Here, researchers describe a new method, called MetMap, that corrects for these inaccuracies and produces highly accurate data. MetMap can be used to identify regions of our genome that are not methylated, which helps identify areas that might be important for regulating gene activity. The combination of MethylSeq and MetMap is a powerful and cost-effective tool for studying how our genes are regulated and how it relates to our health.

Biomedical Paper 942 Summary:
Researchers created a computer model that simulates brain activity and compared it to real brain scans. They found that the model can reproduce many features of brain activity, including how different brain regions connect and change over time. However, the model is not yet able to perfectly match the specific patterns of brain activity seen in real scans. This suggests that the model may be missing some important factors that control brain activity. These factors could include mechanisms that make brain activity change over time or more accurate mapping of the brain's structural connections.

Biomedical Paper 943 Summary:
In some diseases like ALS and dementia, a protein called TDP-43 clumps together abnormally. Using a worm model, scientists found that TDP-43 plays a role in regulating lifespan and protecting against stress. However, too much TDP-43 can also be harmful. Mutations linked to ALS cause stress that triggers an increase in TDP-43, leading to damage in the brain and shorter lifespan. Interestingly, removing TDP-43 from worms with these mutations can improve their health. This suggests that persistently high levels of TDP-43, even the normal version, might worsen neurodegenerative diseases like ALS.

Biomedical Paper 944 Summary:
Type 2 diabetes is becoming more common, and scientists are looking for new ways to treat it. They believe that genes that control insulin production could be targets for new treatments. The researchers developed a screening system to find genes that affect the insulin gene in beta cells. Using this system, they found several genes that are known to affect insulin secretion. They also found a gene called Gpr27, which has not been known to play a role in beta cells. When they blocked Gpr27 in beta cells, insulin production decreased. They also showed that Gpr27 may activate a signaling pathway that leads to increased insulin production. Overall, their findings suggest that Gpr27 could be a new target for type 2 diabetes treatments.

Biomedical Paper 945 Summary:
As we age, our bodies and minds decline. Scientists are trying to understand this process to help us age healthily. One way to do this is by studying how genes instruct our bodies to function. In fruit flies and worms, a group of genes called ETS transcription factors (TFs) play a role in aging. ETS TFs turn other genes on or off, affecting lifespan and health. Some ETS TFs block aging by turning off other genes, while others promote aging by turning them on. By studying ETS TFs, scientists have found that they work together in a circuit that controls aging. This circuit is found in many different cells and organs in both fruit flies and worms. The balance between the different ETS TFs in this circuit determines how long we live and how healthy we are as we age. This research suggests that ETS TFs may also play a role in aging in humans. By understanding how these genes work, we may be able to develop new treatments to help us live longer and healthier lives.

Biomedical Paper 946 Summary:
This study presents a new microscopy technique to study the process of cells taking in nutrients and other molecules. This technique allows scientists to measure this process with greater accuracy than before. The researchers used this technique to measure the activity of 34 different proteins involved in this process. They found that these proteins work together in a highly coordinated manner to ensure that cells can take in the nutrients they need. This study provides new insights into the fundamental processes that cells use to function.

Biomedical Paper 947 Summary:
Genes need to be expressed at precise levels to function correctly. Scientists studied a gene called Ubx, which is important for fruit fly development. They found that when Ubx levels get too high, it turns off the parts of the gene that control its expression. This shutdown helps keep Ubx levels in check. Tiny changes in Ubx levels or differences in the fly's genetic background can also affect gene expression, suggesting that these changes act as a buffer to ensure proper gene function amidst genetic variations found in nature.

Biomedical Paper 948 Summary:
Buruli ulcer is a treatable but disfiguring disease without a vaccine. Researchers tested nine pieces of the bacteria that cause Buruli ulcer as potential vaccine targets. Two pieces, called acyltransferase (propionate) and enoylreductase, showed stronger immune responses and some protection in mice. However, this protection was weaker than that provided by a known vaccine target and the tuberculosis vaccine. Combining these new targets with existing vaccine approaches may lead to an effective Buruli ulcer vaccine.

Biomedical Paper 950 Summary:
Myotubular myopathy is a rare and severe muscle disease caused by mutations in a gene called myotubularin. Scientists have created a zebrafish model of the disease to study its development and potential treatments. The zebrafish model shows similar muscle defects as those seen in humans with the disease, including muscle weakness, abnormal muscle structure, and positioning of cell nuclei within muscle fibers. The study found that myotubularin regulates levels of a specific molecule (PI3P) in zebrafish muscle. When myotubularin levels are reduced, PI3P levels increase, leading to muscle defects. Scientists also discovered that other related proteins can compensate for the loss of myotubularin in zebrafish, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies. Abnormalities in the muscle's internal network (tubulo-reticular network) and defects in the process that triggers muscle contraction (excitation-contraction coupling) were observed in the zebrafish model and human muscle biopsies. These findings suggest that myotubular myopathy may be related to other muscle diseases caused by defects in calcium regulation within muscle cells.

Biomedical Paper 951 Summary:
Translation, the process of converting genetic information into proteins, is controlled by proteins that attach to mRNA, the blueprint for protein synthesis. PABP, a protein that binds to the end of mRNA, helps turn on translation but can also help turn it off. Another protein, hnRNP-Q2, can block PABP from binding to mRNA. When this happens, hnRNP-Q2 promotes translation and prevents specific mRNAs from being turned off. In cells, reducing the amount of hnRNP-Q2 enhances translation, while adding it back inhibits translation. This competition between PABP and hnRNP-Q2 is crucial for controlling protein production and specific mRNA repression, impacting cell function.

Biomedical Paper 952 Summary:
Researchers have studied Google Flu Trends (GFT), an online system that tracks flu cases based on Internet searches. They found that GFT models had errors in predicting flu outbreaks. GFT missed the first wave of the 2009 flu pandemic and overestimated the flu outbreak in 2012/2013. This is concerning because GFT results have been used to guide flu-related decisions. Overall, GFT is unreliable for tracking the flu and should not be used as a substitute for traditional flu surveillance systems.

Biomedical Paper 953 Summary:
Frataxin, a protein essential for energy production in cells, is missing in people with Friedreich's ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease. Scientists used yeast to study frataxin's role and found that a specific change in a protein called Isu1 could make up for the lack of frataxin. This change improved the formation of crucial molecules that power cells and prevented the problems seen in yeast lacking frataxin. Interestingly, this change is similar to what's found in bacteria, suggesting that this feature is ancient and conserved in nature. Understanding these details may help unravel the causes of Friedreich's ataxia and potentially lead to new treatments.

Biomedical Paper 954 Summary:
Understanding how fish swim requires studying their muscle use. Scientists used computer models to study the forces and energy on a fish's body as it swims. They found that the forces needed to move the fish create a wave pattern that travels along its body faster than the wave of muscle contractions. This wave pattern explains the speed of muscle contractions. Notably, some muscles stop contracting towards the tail, even though forces are still present. This is because tendons transfer forces and energy from the body to the tail, allowing for reduced muscle contraction duration. In one type of swimming (carangiform), the elasticity of the body also affects the muscle contraction pattern. The study highlights how muscles and tendons work together to drive fish swimming, particularly in terms of energy usage. It also shows differences in muscle use between two main swimming styles in fish.

Biomedical Paper 955 Summary:
Some nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells show stem-like features, but what controls this isn't fully understood. The Epstein-Barr virus is linked to NPC, and its LMP2A protein is involved in cancer development. Researchers found that most NPC tumors tested had high levels of LMP2A, especially in the areas where the tumor spreads. Adding LMP2A to NPC cells in the lab increased their ability to invade and spread, and it also influenced the expression of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process in cancer development. LMP2A also enhanced these cells' capacity to form colonies, grow in soft agar, and renew themselves, suggesting a stem cell-like behavior. In animal models, LMP2A increased the number of tumor-initiating cells. Additionally, a correlation was observed between LMP2A and a stem cell marker in human NPC samples. Finally, inhibiting a specific pathway (Akt) reduced the number of stem-like cells. These results suggest that LMP2A promotes EMT and stem-like behavior in NPC, providing insights into how Epstein-Barr virus may contribute to NPC development and metastasis.

These worms have a special pathway involving a protein called PMK-1 and a transcription factor called ATF-7 that controls their immune system. Using advanced technology, scientists studied what happens when worms are infected with bacteria. They found that PMK-1 and ATF-7 regulate most of the genes that are turned on to fight the infection. ATF-7 binds to specific regions of these genes, allowing them to be activated. Scientists also showed that some of these ATF-7-regulated genes play a direct role in protecting worms from infection. This study reveals the critical role of PMK-1 and ATF-7 in coordinating the worm's immune response against infection, providing insights into how our own immune systems might work.

Biomedical Paper 957 Summary:
**Summary for Layperson:** A gene called SMYD4 plays a vital role in heart development. In zebrafish, a fish used for scientific research, researchers altered the smyd4 gene to study its effects. They found that zebrafish without a functional smyd4 gene developed serious heart problems, such as misalignment and underdevelopment. In humans, two rare genetic changes in SMYD4 were linked to heart birth defects. Further studies showed that these changes made the SMYD4 protein less effective. SMYD4 works by modifying proteins in a specific way, and it also interacts with another protein that alters how genes are turned on and off. By examining gene activity in zebrafish hearts, researchers learned that smyd4 affects pathways involved in processing proteins and metabolism. This suggests that SMYD4 is an important regulator of gene activity and heart development, and that changes in this gene can lead to heart birth defects in humans.

Biomedical Paper 958 Summary:
Trypanosoma brucei is a parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and animals. To live and infect, it must make a building block called thymine for its DNA. Surprisingly, we found that one enzyme involved in thymine synthesis, called thymidine kinase (TK), is essential for the parasite's survival and infection. This enzyme helps convert thymidine into usable forms of thymine. Normally, parasites have alternative ways to make thymine, but we found that T. brucei lacks one of these alternative pathways, making TK essential. Further analysis revealed that the parasite has an unknown enzyme that converts thymine nucleotides into unused forms, creating a shortage when TK is missing. By identifying potential candidates for this unknown enzyme, we discovered a protein that can convert thymine nucleotides back into their usable forms. This finding highlights the importance of TK in thymine synthesis for T. brucei and other similar parasites. Targeting TK with drugs could be a promising approach for treating infections caused by these parasites.

Biomedical Paper 959 Summary:
Insects need two hormones (ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones) to grow and change through different stages of life. Juvenile hormones stop insects from changing too early and let them shed their skin (molt) several times until they reach the right size. Scientists studied a silkworm that molts less than it should and changes into a moth too early. They found a damaged gene responsible for this problem, called CYP15C1. This gene is needed for making juvenile hormones. When the silkworm was given an artificial version of the hormone, it could molt normally. The scientists also found that the CYP15C1 gene is only active in the organ that makes juvenile hormones. This study shows that the CYP15C1 gene is essential for making juvenile hormones in silkworms. Interestingly, the silkworm starts changing too early without enough of this hormone, but only after it has molted a few times. This finding helps us understand how hormones control insect development and growth.

Biomedical Paper 960 Summary:
Our bodies have an internal "clock" that regulates important processes like sleep and wakefulness, and metabolism. This clock is located in the brain and controls many other "mini-clocks" throughout the body. Scientists have created a mathematical model to study how this clock works. They used information from experiments to build a computer model that can simulate the clock's behavior. Using this model, they found that the rate at which certain genes break down can affect the length of the clock's cycle. They also discovered a role for a specific part of the clock system that was previously thought to be a helper. Their model suggests that this part may actually be an independent oscillator, which could change our understanding of how the clock functions. This new information may lead to better treatments for disorders that affect the body's clock.

Biomedical Paper 961 Summary:
DNA is made up of different units, like alpha satellite DNA, which is found in the center of chromosomes in primates (like humans and monkeys). It's hard to study this DNA because it's very repetitive, making it difficult to assemble in the same way as other DNA. Researchers have developed a new method to find and sort alpha satellite DNA from existing data. They've used this to compare the alpha satellite DNA of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques, finding that it has changed over time in different ways in these species. This helps understand how chromosomes have evolved in primates.

Biomedical Paper 962 Summary:
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) uses a small protein called p7 as a "gatekeeper" for viral assembly. P7 normally becomes active when it's cut into two pieces. However, if this cut is delayed, it can trap another viral protein (E2) inside the cell, reducing the amount of E2 that makes it into new virus particles. Further research showed that the delay in cutting p7 also affects how well the virus assembles its protective envelope. The first part of p7 that's cut off, known as the "tail," plays a critical role in bringing together two other viral proteins (NS5A and NS2) that are needed for envelope formation. By studying mutant viruses with different cutting rates, scientists found that the timing of p7 tail release is essential for: * Regulating E2 levels and preventing it from getting trapped inside the cell * Coordinating viral assembly by linking envelope proteins to the viral core * Ensuring proper packaging of the virus's genetic material This research highlights the importance of p7 and its timely cutting in the complex process of HCV assembly and transmission.

Biomedical Paper 963 Summary:
Flies have very small and flexible bodies that allow them to fly with great agility. Their wings are controlled by many small, powerful muscles that contract to change the shape of the body and the position of the wings. Scientists used special technology to see how these muscles work in blowflies. They discovered that the muscles use many different ways to move the wings, and they can store and release energy to help the fly control its movements in the air. These findings show that the flexibility of the fly's body and muscles is essential for its ability to fly and maneuver.

Biomedical Paper 964 Summary:
DNA replication in cells normally starts at multiple locations called origins. When origins fail to start, large gaps can occur between them. Researchers studied how cells handle these gaps using a modified yeast chromosome that lacked all origins. They identified genes involved in DNA damage and replication stress signaling that help replicate these gaps. One of these genes, Rad9p, is specific to DNA damage, suggesting that the DNA damage response pathway plays a role in maintaining chromosome stability. However, the mechanism by which this pathway contributes to stability is independent of DNA damage and involves a specific protein (Chk1p) that becomes more important when another protein (Rad53p) is missing. These findings suggest that components of the DNA damage response pathway contribute to genome stability beyond their role in detecting and repairing DNA damage, by facilitating the replication of large gaps between replication origins.

Biomedical Paper 965 Summary:
Proteins are essential for life, but sometimes they can misbehave by clumping together (aggregating). These clumps are linked to diseases like Alzheimer's. To prevent this, cells have systems to break down bad proteins. However, some proteins, like those found in prion diseases, can trick these systems. Scientists studied proteins that tend to aggregate easily. They found that certain features, like big or oily parts of the protein, can make them both more likely to aggregate and be broken down. But this doesn't always happen. In some cases, big or oily parts can actually help prevent breakdown and instead make the protein more likely to form clumps. This suggests that certain proteins may be able to get around the cell's cleanup systems and form clumps that cause diseases. Understanding how these proteins behave could help us find ways to prevent or treat diseases like Alzheimer's.

Biomedical Paper 966 Summary:
Type VII glycogen storage disease (GSD VII) is a rare genetic disorder affecting muscles and other tissues. It is caused by mutations in the gene for muscle phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFKM), an important enzyme involved in energy production. In GSD VII, PFKM deficiency leads to impaired energy production in muscles, causing muscle weakness and intolerance to exercise. However, recent studies suggest that the disease also affects other tissues, including red blood cells and the heart. To better understand the full impact of GSD VII, researchers created mice lacking PFKM (Pfkm−/− mice). These mice showed severe muscle weakness and reduced lifespan. They had high glycogen storage in their muscles and low levels of ATP (energy currency), indicating impaired energy production. Additionally, the mice had decreased levels of a molecule in red blood cells that helps transport oxygen, leading to hemolysis (red blood cell destruction). This resulted in anemia, enlarged spleen, and compensatory production of new red blood cells. Cardiac hypertrophy (enlarged heart) was also observed, likely due to reduced PFKM activity in the heart. Overall, these findings reveal that GSD VII is not solely a muscle disease but involves systemic alterations in energy production and metabolism. The complex interplay between these changes contributes

Biomedical Paper 967 Summary:
Immune cells form a special junction, called the immunological synapse, with other cells. During this process, proteins on the cell membrane move and cluster together to trigger an immune response. We propose a simple mathematical model to explain how this protein clustering occurs. Our model considers the mechanics of the cell membrane, the way proteins bind to each other, and the flow of fluid between the cells. We predict how quickly and where proteins will cluster based on the stiffness of the membrane, the strength of protein binding, and the fluid flow. Our model agrees with experimental data, suggesting that the formation of protein clusters does not require active processes involving the cell's internal skeleton. We find that two key factors determine the patterns that form: the ratio of membrane stiffness to protein stiffness, and the ratio of fluid flow to protein binding rate. Our model provides a framework for understanding how immune cells communicate and respond to external stimuli.

Biomedical Paper 968 Summary:
Leprosy's Type 1 reactions can damage nerves and cause disabilities. They are usually treated with prednisolone tablets, but the best dose and duration is not clear. The immune system plays a key role in these reactions. Methylprednisolone, an anti-inflammatory drug, has been used in other immune-related diseases. Researchers compared 42 people with Type 1 reactions and nerve damage. Half received three days of high-dose methylprednisolone followed by prednisolone tablets. The other half received prednisolone tablets alone. While both groups showed improvement, those who received methylprednisolone had less nerve damage after 29 days. The study suggests that longer courses of corticosteroids may be beneficial, and further research is needed to identify people who may require additional treatment.

Understanding this connection may aid in developing new treatments for prostate cancer.

Biomedical Paper 970 Summary:
Many viruses that can infect animals or cause disease in humans (like the virus that causes colds) change their genetic makeup very easily, which allows them to adapt to different situations and different hosts. However, some viruses that are transmitted by insects (called arboviruses) are known to experience sudden decreases in their genetic diversity (genetic bottlenecks) when they move between insect and animal hosts. This genetic bottleneck could mean that the virus is more likely to become extinct or unable to spread to new hosts. To understand how this happens, scientists studied a virus called Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and the mosquitoes that carry it. They found that the virus's genetic diversity consistently dropped when it moved from one part of the mosquito's body to another, suggesting that genetic bottlenecks can occur throughout the virus's life cycle within the mosquito. This bottleneck effect may have significant implications for the virus's ability to survive and spread, but more research is needed to understand the virus's mechanisms for preventing genetic drift that could lead to its extinction.

Q fever is a disease spread by animals, mostly cows, sheep, and goats. A study on Reunion Island found that 12% of cows, 1% of sheep, and 13% of goats tested positive for the bacteria that causes Q fever. The bacteria was also found in some vaginal swabs and milk samples. The study suggests that Q fever infection in animals is more likely when farms are exposed to strong winds and visitors don't take precautions before entering. However, infection is less likely when farms have quarantine measures for new animals and when animals return to the farm at night.

Genes work together in networks, and computers can use data from experiments to predict these networks. However, computers often choose genes randomly, which can lead to inaccurate models. This study found that using information from scientific papers about how genes interact can improve the accuracy of computer models. Researchers tested their method on two sets of data, one from breast cancer cells and one from yeast. The new method performed significantly better than the current best method, and the resulting networks included both known and new relationships between genes. This approach can help us better understand how cells work and make decisions about how to treat diseases.

Biomedical Paper 973 Summary:
Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics, making it harder to treat infections. The most common way bacteria becomes resistant is through changes in their DNA. Scientists believed these changes would always make it harder for bacteria to survive. However, they have recently discovered that in some cases, one antibiotic resistance change can help bacteria survive if they already have a different antibiotic resistance change. In this study, scientists looked at two types of antibiotic resistance changes in bacteria: changes in the bacteria's own DNA and changes acquired from other bacteria. They found that in many cases (40%), these two types of resistance changes together make bacteria more likely to survive. This means that bacteria that have already become resistant to an antibiotic may become even more resistant if they gain additional resistance. The researchers also found that, in most cases (52%), these two types of resistance changes made it harder for bacteria to survive. These findings suggest that it may be difficult to stop bacteria from becoming more resistant to antibiotics, even if we stop using antibiotics.

Biomedical Paper 974 Summary:
Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a drug that selectively kills a type of parasite called Leishmania. This parasite causes a deadly disease that affects skin and internal organs. Researchers investigated how CsA kills Leishmania and found that it targets a group of proteins called cyclophilins (CyPs). They discovered that Leishmania CyPs are very different from human CyPs, but they still have some important parts in common. They also found that CsA directly kills the infective form of the parasite by targeting a specific CyP called LmaCyP40. This study suggests that Leishmania CyPs are essential for the parasite's survival and that targeting them with drugs could be a promising approach for treating Leishmania infections.

Each neuron has a unique "circuitry" setup, making them behave differently. However, some parts of this circuitry may change over time, leading to differences in neuron performance. Researchers used computer simulations to study these changes and found that certain ion channels work together and vary across neurons, affecting how they function. This research helps us understand how neurons communicate and perform different tasks in the brain.

Biomedical Paper 976 Summary:
Our genes are controlled by switches that turn them on and off, and these switches are located in regions of our DNA that do not code for proteins. Changes in these switch regions can affect how genes are turned on and off, but it has been difficult to understand the effects of these changes. In this study, we looked at one of these switches, CTCF, in 12 people from the same family. We studied how changes in the DNA sequence affected where CTCF bound, and we found that many changes had little or no effect, even if they changed the energy of the bond between CTCF and DNA. Surprisingly, we also found that some changes that increased binding occurred at positions where humans differ from chimpanzees, suggesting that some changes that are good for us may have happened quite recently in our evolution. Our results show that it is difficult to predict the effects of changes in these switch regions based on DNA sequence alone, and that we need to study these effects directly in cells to understand how they affect gene expression.

Hookworms infect millions worldwide, causing anemia. Drugs help but parasites quickly return and can become drug-resistant. A vaccine would be ideal. We tested three hookworm proteins as possible vaccine candidates in hamsters. One protein, called AceyCP1, showed promise. Hamsters that received this protein had lower worm numbers, egg counts, and symptoms than those that did not. The vaccine induced antibodies that attacked the worms and reduced their movement. It also triggered immune responses known to fight parasites. These results suggest that AceyCP1 is a promising vaccine candidate, validating our approach to finding new vaccines for hookworm.

Biomedical Paper 978 Summary:
Chromosomal insertions are rare genetic changes where a piece of DNA gets inserted into another location in the genome. Scientists studied 16 people with these insertions and found that most of them occurred through a process that resembles how genetic material gets copied during cell division. This process involves temporary changes in the DNA structure and repeated switches between different DNA strands as templates. In some cases, these insertions appeared to be balanced, meaning that no DNA was gained or lost overall. However, further analysis revealed that these balanced insertions often had subtle changes in the DNA structure nearby, suggesting that they may have arisen through a process of "chromothripsis" where multiple chromosomes get scrambled and rearranged.

Biomedical Paper 979 Summary:
Certain insects host bacteria inside their cells that often help each other by exchanging molecules. Some bacteria living together have similar ways of acquiring food, like obtaining all their nutrients from their host insect. However, scientists have discovered that two particular bacteria species, Sulcia and Baumannia, living inside the same insect, have strikingly different ways of obtaining their food. This study shows that Sulcia can get all its carbon (a type of food) from the host insect without needing help from Baumannia. Surprisingly, Baumannia needs Sulcia's help to get two essential amino acids (building blocks of proteins) from the host. This discovery shows how different bacteria can work together in interesting ways inside their host insect, even though they have different food requirements.

Biomedical Paper 980 Summary:
When a virus infects us, our immune system needs to be able to recognize the virus and mount an effective response to clear the infection. One important way our immune system does this is through the actions of CD8+ T cells (TCD8+). These cells can recognize and kill virus-infected cells. There are two main ways that TCD8+ cells can be activated: through direct presentation (DP) and cross-presentation (CP). In DP, the virus-infected cell itself presents the viral antigen to the TCD8+ cell. In CP, the viral antigen is taken up by a different cell, which then presents it to the TCD8+ cell. It has been unclear which of these two mechanisms is more important for priming TCD8+ cells against viruses. In this study, the researchers used vaccinia virus (VACV) as a model system to investigate this question. VACV is a virus that has been used as a vaccine to rid the world of smallpox and is proposed as a vector for many other vaccines. The researchers found that DP is the main mechanism for the priming of an anti-viral TCD8+ response to VACV. This finding provides important insights into our understanding of how one of the most effective anti-viral vaccines

Despite the common practice of monitoring mosquito populations to predict dengue outbreaks, there is limited evidence that mosquito levels accurately indicate dengue transmission. A review of 18 studies found that: - Most studies used weak methods. - Only 11 of 18 studies measured mosquito levels in both larva and adult stages. - 13 studies investigated the relationship between mosquito levels and dengue cases, with mixed results: some found positive, negative, or no correlation. - Six of seven studies found dengue transmission even when mosquito levels were below the accepted threshold for predicting outbreaks. This review highlights the need for better standardized methods and more research to determine if mosquito levels can reliably predict dengue outbreaks.

A large study investigated how malnutrition and malaria during pregnancy affect the risk of low birth weight babies. They found that malnutrition and malaria infection each increase the risk, but they don't worsen the risk together. Pregnant women with both malnutrition and malaria have a higher risk of low birth weight babies than those with just one risk factor or none. However, the combined effect of malnutrition and malaria is not more than the sum of their individual effects.

Biomedical Paper 983 Summary:
Imagine a cell as a machine that must adapt to its environment. Inside the cell, a network of regulatory rules controls the production of proteins, like a conductor leading an orchestra. Scientists have developed a mathematical tool to represent this network as a matrix, like a giant spreadsheet. This tool allows them to predict how the cell will respond to different environmental conditions. They applied this tool to the bacterium Escherichia coli, which has a very large regulatory network. By studying the matrix, they found that the cell's responses are not always simple and direct. Instead, the network acts like a distributed system with many interconnected parts. This means that changes in the environment can trigger a wide range of responses, depending on the specific combination of conditions. The tool also helps identify areas where our knowledge of the regulatory network is lacking, which can guide future experiments. Overall, this new approach provides a powerful way to understand how cells sense and adapt to their surroundings.

Biomedical Paper 984 Summary:
Sand flies carry bacteria in their gut that play a key role in their immune system and help them fight off diseases like leishmaniasis. These bacteria are acquired from the environment, especially during the sand fly's early life stages when it lives in soil. The type and amount of bacteria vary depending on the sand fly species and where it lives. Scientists have found that two common gut bacteria, Pantoea and Bacillus, can settle in different parts of the digestive tract and influence how the immune system responds to infections. The bacteria's ability to colonize the gut is partly influenced by the acidity level within the gut, creating a unique environment that shapes the sand fly's immune response.

Biomedical Paper 985 Summary:
Hookworm infection is common in many poor tropical regions, where it can lead to health problems. Worms that cause hookworm have the ability to hide from the body's immune system, which normally fights off infections. This study investigated the immune response of people infected with hookworm. They found that infected individuals had higher levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are immune cells that can suppress other immune cells. Additionally, hookworm antigen stimulation reduced the number of Tregs that also expressed the immune mediator IL-17. These results suggest that Tregs may play a role in the immunosuppression induced by hookworm, allowing the worm to survive longer in infected people.

Biomedical Paper 986 Summary:
West Nile virus (WNV) can remain in the brain and kidneys of infected animals, including humans. In this study, researchers infected mice with a strain of WNV called H8912, isolated from a hamster that had the virus for a long time. They found that WNV H8912 was less likely to invade the brain of mice compared to other strains of the virus. After infection, the virus was first detected in the blood and spleen, and later in the kidneys. The virus could be detected in the kidneys for up to 2.5 months after infection, and the mice had mild kidney inflammation. The researchers also found that the immune system of the mice produced less of a response to WNV H8912 than to other strains of the virus. Finally, when the virus was injected directly into the brains of mice, it was less likely to cause severe disease and damage to neurons compared to other WNV strains. Overall, this study suggests that WNV H8912 is less harmful to mice compared to other strains of the virus.

Biomedical Paper 987 Summary:
Viruses can make proteins that shut down the body's natural defense against them, called RNA silencing. Scientists have identified a new viral protein that does this in a plant virus. This protein, called P1, turns off the body's ability to fight the virus by binding to a key protein in the body's defense system. This discovery helps scientists understand how viruses evade our defenses and how we can improve our ability to fight them.

Biomedical Paper 988 Summary:
In rural Uganda, a study found that about 35% of adults have been exposed to the Leptospira bacteria, which causes leptospirosis. This is a high rate, suggesting that exposure is common. The study also found that 1.9% of adults had signs of recent leptospirosis, possibly due to the "Nigeria" strain of the bacteria. Risk factors for exposure include having contact with cattle or monkeys, and having had malaria within the past year. The study highlights the need to consider leptospirosis as a possible cause of fever, especially in cases where malaria tests are negative.

Biomedical Paper 989 Summary:
Mitochondria, the powerhouses of our cells, carry DNA that can accumulate mutations. The amount and spread of these mutations can make us sick. Researchers used math to study how cells control these mutations and found that: * Too many mutations can make it costly for tissues to function. * Having some mutations can be worse than having none, even if the mutation is harmful. * Gene therapies that aim to correct mutations need to spread the corrections as widely as possible to be effective. * It's better to gradually correct mutations over a long time rather than quickly and intensely.

Biomedical Paper 990 Summary:
During development, the body's basic structure is formed by creating three cell layers: the skin (ectoderm), muscles (mesoderm), and organs (endoderm). Normally, these layers stay separated. In some animals, however, the skin acts as a pathway for the muscle layer to move. We found that the boundary between the skin and muscle layers is a special zone where cells can briefly detach and reattach. This allows the muscle cells to move along the skin. This process involves signals that tell the cells when to detach and attach, like a stop-and-go sign. These signals are triggered by molecules that are sent back and forth across the boundary. This process is different from the simple separation of cell layers by stickiness. Instead, it involves specific interactions and allows for cells to move across each other, like a conveyor belt.

Biomedical Paper 991 Summary:
Chagas disease, caused by a parasite, affects millions in Latin America. Currently, there are only two drugs available for treatment, but they have side effects and don't always work well in the later stages of the disease. Researchers have developed a new method to quickly screen collections of chemicals for new drugs. They use a custom-made computer program to count the number of parasite cells and host cells in images of infected cells taken under a microscope. This method provides three pieces of information: whether the chemical kills the parasite, whether the chemical is toxic to host cells, and the percentage of cells infected. This method is highly accurate and can be used with any strain of the parasite. It will help researchers identify new drugs that specifically target and kill the parasite.

Biomedical Paper 992 Summary:
In decision-making, the brain uses "maps" to understand where it is and what actions to take. These maps are not given to the brain but must be learned. Scientists wanted to know if the brain can learn these maps without being explicitly taught. They studied rats in a maze with multiple steps to the goal. Initially, the rats acted as if they did not know the maze was sequential. However, as they learned, they developed a more accurate map, including the multiple steps. Interestingly, the number of actions the rats considered also increased with experience. The findings suggest that the brain builds decision-making maps gradually based on experience and the complexity of the task.

Biomedical Paper 993 Summary:
Our cells have a stress-defense mechanism controlled by a pathway involving insulin and a protein called DAF-16. Scientists searched for genes that enhance stress resistance in tiny worms and found one called "natc-1". Loss of natc-1 made the worms more resilient to various stresses like heat and harmful metals. DAF-16 can control natc-1 levels, suggesting that natc-1 acts downstream of DAF-16 in the stress-defense pathway. It's thought that natc-1 might achieve this by regulating how proteins are modified (N-terminal acetylation), potentially playing a vital role in stress tolerance and longevity.

Biomedical Paper 994 Summary:
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a molecule that coats the surface of the bacteria that cause melioidosis. Different types of LPS can make bacteria more or less harmful. Researchers looked at genetic differences in LPS to understand these differences. They identified three main types of LPS in the bacteria: typical, atypical, and a new type called B2. The typical type was most common in Southeast Asia, while the atypical type was more common in Australia. The B2 type was found in a few strains of bacteria. The researchers also found changes in the genes that make LPS, which could lead to a different type of LPS called "rough." These different types of LPS may affect how the bacteria cause disease and how the body responds to them.

Biomedical Paper 995 Summary:
Cells can react differently to signals from outside the cell. How quickly the cell's receptors, which receive these signals, move around inside the cell affects how strong the signals are and how variable the cell's responses are. Our team measured how much these receptors move around in individual cells using special imaging and mathematical models. In lung cancer cells, we found that receptors move around quickly and that these movements are similar to what we found in other types of cells. Interestingly, the difference in how receptors move around between different cells is large, but the strength of the signals received by the cells is similar due to the coordinated movement of receptors. Understanding these receptor movements could help us understand how cells communicate and respond to their environment, which could lead to new treatments for diseases.

Biomedical Paper 996 Summary:
When we make a decision, we also think about how uncertain we are about it. This process of monitoring and adjusting our decisions is called metacognition. Scientists have argued about how our brains handle metacognition - some think it uses a separate brain system, while others think it relies on the same systems we use to make decisions. To study this, researchers conducted brain scans on people making decisions. They found that different parts of the brain were active when people made a decision and then changed it compared to when they made the decision the first time. One area, called the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC), was especially active after the initial decision. Within this area, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was more active when people were more uncertain about their decision and when they did better at monitoring this uncertainty. Another area, called the lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), was more active when people changed their decision and when they made more accurate decisions. These results suggest that the PFC does contain a separate system for metacognition and that different parts of this system handle different aspects of metacognition, such as monitoring uncertainty and adjusting decisions.

Biomedical Paper 997 Summary:
The brain and nervous system start out as simple sheets of cells. Specific genes then turn on in different parts of these sheets to make different types of nerve cells. In fruit flies, for example, the optic lobes develop into the fly's brain. One gene, Atonal, is key to making the optic lobes, while another gene, Tailless, is key to making the fly's larval eyes. Other genes, like Hedgehog and Notch, work together to control which gene turns on in each part of the sheet. This network of genes ensures that the right types of nerve cells form in the right places and at the right time, creating a complex nervous system.

Biomedical Paper 998 Summary:
Bacteria that live inside cells, like Mycobacterium leprae, often hide from our immune system's defenses. This bacterium causes leprosy, and our study found that it tricks our immune cells (macrophages) into not fighting it off. Normally, macrophages have a "vitamin D pathway" that helps them kill bacteria. But when M. leprae infects macrophages, it sends out a signal that blocks this pathway. We discovered that the signal was a molecule called "type I interferon." When we blocked type I interferon, the macrophages could turn on the vitamin D pathway and kill the bacteria. This suggests that M. leprae evades our immune system by triggering type I interferon, which keeps our defenses from working effectively. Understanding this could lead to new treatments for leprosy and other infections.

Biomedical Paper 999 Summary:
In some poor Brazilian villages, a skin disease called tungiasis is common, spread by animals like dogs and pigs. Researchers studied ways to reduce this disease. In one village, people and animals were treated, and the houses were sprayed with insecticide. In a nearby village, nothing was done (the control). After a year, tungiasis was much less common in the treated village (10%) than the control village (43%). But after stopping treatment, the disease came back in both villages. This shows that treating people and animals can reduce tungiasis, but to keep it away, it's important to do it regularly and also control the animals that carry the disease.

Biomedical Paper 1000 Summary:
C. difficile bacteria spores can cause infections in humans. To spread, these spores must first germinate, which is triggered by certain chemicals called "germinants." Scientists have identified one of these germinants (bile acids), but the other (amino acids) has remained unknown. Researchers used a technique called mutagenesis to create bacterial strains with changes in their germination requirements. They discovered strains that only needed bile acids to germinate and identified mutations in a gene called yabG. This gene produces a protein that helps process proteins needed for germination. Further experiments revealed that changes in a different gene, cspA, also allowed spores to germinate with only bile acids. CspA is known to help another protein that acts as a germinant receptor. This study suggests that two proteins (CspC and CspA) may work together as the receptors that recognize germinants and trigger spore germination in C. difficile, providing new insights into this critical process.
